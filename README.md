## Creating CASE

> Case is a personal project that I used to learn the basics of full-stack web-development. Unfortunately, due to being on a student budget and taking a full time course schedule, I was only able to make a proof of concept (shown below). However, I learned a great amount of new knowledge and information.

### Technologies Used

1. MongoDB
2. ExpressJS for API
3. ReactJS for frontend development
4. Nodejs

### MongoDB:

> I enjoyed working with a nosql database for this project. I was able to structure my data exactly how I wanted to in my ExpressJS api which made CRUD a fairly easy and enjoyable experience.

### ExpressJS:

> This section of the project is where I learned the most. Before starting case, I didn't have a great understanding of how full-stack web applications worked. However, after creating different endpoints, schemas, and even implementing my own login system using jsonwebtokens I feel much more confident in my knowledge of full-stack applicatons. I see how these systems not only work for web applcations, but mobile as well. Learning backend development was very interesting and fun.

### ReactJS:

> I had dabbled in React before this project, but my understanding of the React libray is ten fold what it used to be. I will admit, building front-ends has always been a little bit of a weakness for me. However, I feel more confident after learning different react features such as conditional rendering, states, redux, etc... Tailwindcss helped quite a bit too. I really liked tailwind. It had great documentation, and made mobile first design very simple.
